Ohana is an app targetted to families that would like to organize family time events. It allows the creation of a family event by date and time, suggestions of things to do by all of those in the family, and provide a methood of family members to vote on any and all suggestions.  Not sure what to suggest?  No problem.  Our Public Dashboard of other family events can be used to generate ideas for your family event, or you can even grab that specific event and make it a suggestion for yours.  If you wish, you can even contact the original family and inquire about joining them.  The main purpose is to give a voice to all family or friend members on how they would like to spend time together.  Ohana will help achieve that and make sure that no one is left behind!!!

### Tech



### How does it work?

After creating a Family, account and signing in, you will be directed to your Family Dashboard page.  At this point, click on the "+" field to create a new event suggestion:

From there you can input the details of the event you wish to add as a suggestion.
For convenience, a calendar drop down and location auto-fill option(using google api) is available:

After clicking the "Save" button, the event suggestion is added to your "Event Ballot" with all of the details:

Once all suggestions have been created, members of the family can vote on any or all suggested events by clicking on the heart symbol underneath the Votes icon:

After the deadline for voting on suggested events has passed(set by the event creator) or the "Tally and Publish" button has been clicked, the app will take the event with the most votes and publish it to the Public Dashboard page:

However, if a family member sees an event on the Public Dashboard that they would like to suggest..... instead of having to remember and copying over the details in a new event, they can simply click on the "Bookmark" icon of an event on the Public Dashboard page and it will be copied over to the currently selected event ballot:
